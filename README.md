The Nintendo Switch is a video game console developed by Nintendo, released worldwide in most regions on March 3, 2017. In this case competition, I was tasked to forecast the US sales of Nintendo Switch in the first week in May.

The following code is run through Jupyter Notebook. I work with Scikit-Learn, the machine learning framework, to build different regression models to predict the sales amount of Nintendo Switch and evaluate them with cross validation.

## Final Prediction

These 4 models achieve similar performance so I combine them together. I calculate the reciprocals of their MAEs and normalized them in order to give the models their weights respectively. The final result is the weighted sum of their prediction, which is 56638. This number is closest to the actual sales amount so I won 1st place in this competition.
