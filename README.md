This data originally came from Crowdflower's Data for Everyone library. This is one of the side projects I've done. I want to know what makes the passengers satisfied or unsatisfied with their flight. This is a simple sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques.

From the word cloud we can see that things like delay and customer service matter a lot to the passengers. The Airlines want to focus more on these.

## Modeling

In this project, I use scikit-learn to build classic machine learning models and keras to build neural networks. LSTM is good at dealing with sequantial data and it achieves best performance when classifying the sentiment of the tweets (91% accuracy).
